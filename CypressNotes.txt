Create a folder "UdemyCypress".

To create package.json do : npm init
Create .gitignore : An easy way to get a default git ignore without messing about with create/copy/paste is to use the curl command from the terminal. First cd into your projects root directory and then run the command by replacing MY_API_NAME with your API name from one of the following two sources:
https://www.gitignore.io/
curl -o .gitignore https://www.gitignore.io/api/MY_API_NAME

https://github.com/github/gitignore
curl -o .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/MY_API_NAME.gitignore

Install Cypress by: npm install --save-dev cypress
npx cypress open

Upload to Github:
git remote add origin https://github.com/vaibhav-arde/UdemyCypress.git
git push -u origin master

Section 2: Getting Handle With Cypress

5. Console based Test Runner:
npx cypress run --spec /Users/vaibhavbarde/Desktop/Project/VaibhaV/UdemyCypress/cypress/integration/testApp/va.01login.js
or
npx cypress run --spec /Users/vaibhavbarde/Desktop/Project/VaibhaV/UdemyCypress/cypress/integration/testApp/va.01login.js --browser chrome
---------------------------------------

6. Interacting with UI elements with Cypress
click({force:true})
Type()
Clear()
Check()
Select()
---------------------------------------------
7. Advance Cypress commands (cypress/integration/testApp/va.07handleTable.js)
visit()
get()
wrap(later)
parent
find() : Get the descendent DOM elements of a specific selector, more like query behavior of JQuery
filter() : Get the DOM element that match a specific selector
each
---------------------------------------------
8. Working with Cypress Variables (cypress/integration/testApp/va.08variables.js)

In Cypress all the code line accumulate in a queue and all together its a gigantic queue.
To define variables need to use .then()
variables are not accessible outside .then()
Need to use alias to store variables.

implicit and explicit assertions?
---------------------------------------------
9. Understanding Alias (cypress/integration/testApp/va.09alias.js)
Alias are very special construct in Cypress which has many different applications something like
1. Accessing variables outside of then(), hooks ect
2. Working with UI elements
3. Working with cy.fixtures()- DDT (Data Driven Testing), to read files
4. Working with Routes for XHR and API testing
---------------------------------------------
10. Working with Alias for UI Operation
(cypress/integration/testApp/va.10multiRowOfTable.js)
---------------------------------------------
11. Cypress wrap commands (cypress/integration/testApp/va.11wrap.js)
Wrap yields the object passed into it: It will give actual object properties and members wrap in it
---------------------------------------------
12. Implicit and Explicit Assertions: (cypress/integration/testApp/va.12assertions.js)
Cypress bundles the popular Chai assertion liabrary, as well as helpful extensions for Sinon and JQuery bringing dozens of powerful assertions for free.

There are two types of waiting mechannism available in Cypress.
Implicit assertions - expect()
Explicit assertions - should()

Cypress has built-in retry-ability in almost every command and especially, the wait mechanism in assertions are really handy!

----------------------------------------------
13. Cypress hooks (cypress/integration/testApp/va.13hooks.js)
beforeEach
before
afterEach
after
----------------------------------------------
14.Data Driven Testing: (cypress/integration/testApp/va.14ddt.js)
Fixture() and ReadFile()
Fixture and ReadFile are two different methods available in Cypress to read or work with external files.
They do have similar behaviour with minor differences but they work very well in reading the files of many types

Cypress reads these file types, but uf you specify just the file name without extensions, it will read in these orders.
    json
    js
    coffee
    html
    txt
    csv
    pmng
    jpg
    jpeg
    gif
    tif
    tiff
    zip
